Ideas:

I believe pitches are shown in the data in the exact time they occur no matter
what game that pitch was thrown in. This makes the games all interconnected. 

To get data on pitch sequencing, we have to order the dataset correctly for the
whole season.

Not sure how this will be stored but the rough first try at creating this should
be for the pitches to first be grouped by game_id, which is one of the fields in
the dataset. Then group those by the at_bat_number of the particular game.

After that, all at bats will be grouped. Then order the pitches in the at bat by
the pitch_number, which specifies which pitch of the at bat it was. 

Once all this is completed, then I will be able to write queries about the
different pitches when being preceded by a specific pitch and look for actionable
data that I can use.
